At Google, if you go to the bathroom, you might find yourself reading a flyer posted in the bathroom stall about testing code. [Testing on the toilet](https://testing.googleblog.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html) is a program at Google that would write and post these short little one pagers.  You can read the public version of these posts [on Google's test blog](https://testing.googleblog.com/search/label/TotT).

Thinking about this the other day, the hygiene I most want to do is to keep up with different papers that I find interesting. So, this is my attempt at "papers on the toilet". Note that I plan to update these posts, so timestamping may be crazy. You can look in the [github repo](https://github.com/dabacon/dabacon.github.io) if you'd like to investigate what was changed when.

About my workflow: most of the papers I care about are coming from the arXiv. I have [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) on my Mac and I have written a very simple Citation Style Language file [smarkdown.csl](utils/smarkdown.csl) that I can then use to do a quick export to copy and paste the markdown.

**Quantum physics needs complex numbers**, Marc-Olivier Renou, David Trillo, Mirjam Weilenmann, Le Phuc Thinh, Armin Tavakoli, Nicolas Gisin, Antonio Acin, Miguel Navascues [http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10873)

> **Comments** Quantum theory can be formulated as using complex numbers or using only real numbers.  There is a cute little trick that says, from a computing perspective, these have the same computational power: you use an extra qubit in real number quantum computing to simulate complex number quantum computing. One thing about this mapping, however, is that it is non-local, i.e. everyone has to share the same qubit.  I've often wondered if there was a way to make this local, i.e. to make it so that only say neighbors on some grid of qubits share nearest neighbor extra qubits.  But what I didn't think about is this paper.  It seems to show that there is a Bell inequality type experiment you can do that can separate the two theories.  It will be cool to see this experiment actually performed in the lab: it looks like it requires entangled measurements, but otherwise may be feasible.

**Information Scrambling in Computationally Complex Quantum Circuits**, Xiao Mi, Pedram Roushan, Chris Quintana, Salvatore Mandra, Jeffrey Marshall, Charles Neill, ... Hartmut Neven, Igor Aleiner, Kostyantyn Kechedzhi, Vadim Smelyanskiy, Yu Chen [http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08870)

> **Comments** The latest from the Google quantum team. I was at Google when they were running this experiment and had the honor of talking with one of the authors, Xiao Mi, regularly about the project. It's a nice experiment and shows promise for entering into the quantum advantage regime.

**Large zero-bias peaks in InSb-Al hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowire devices**, Hao Zhang, Michiel W. A. de Moor, Jouri D. S. Bommer, Di Xu, Guanzhong Wang, Nick van Loo, Chun-Xiao Liu, Sasa Gazibegovic, John A. Logan, Diana Car, Roy L. M. Op het Veld, Petrus J. van Veldhoven, Sebastian Koelling, Marcel A. Verheijen, Mihir Pendharkar, Daniel J. Pennachio, Borzoyeh Shojaei, Joon Sue Lee, Chris J. PalmstrÃ¸m, Erik P. A. M. Bakkers, S. Das Sarma, Leo P. Kouwenhoven [http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11456](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11456)

> **Comments** Latest on Microsoft's search for Majorana fermions. Seems that there are multiple interpretations for what they thought was strong evidence of these fermions in their InSb-Al nanowire devices (they call them "good, bad, and ugly" cases.)
